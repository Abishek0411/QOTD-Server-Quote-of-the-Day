# QOTD Server (Quote of the Day)

A simple Python implementation of a Quote of the Day (QOTD) server that listens on a specified port and sends a quote to each client that connects. This server is designed to demonstrate basic TCP socket programming and follows the QOTD protocol's behavior: sending a message and closing the connection.

## Features
- Sends a quote to each connected client
- Continuously runs, allowing multiple clients to connect sequentially
- Lightweight and easy to run on `localhost`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system
- **Telnet** or **Netcat (nc)** for testing (optional but recommended)

### Running the Server
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qotd-server.git
   cd qotd-server

2. **Run the QOTD Server**:
   ```bash
   python qotd_server.py
If everything is set up correctly, you should see:
   ```arduino
   QOTD server running on localhost:1717...
